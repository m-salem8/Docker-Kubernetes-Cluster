# Dockerized FastAPI Application with Kubernetes Deployment
In this project, we build a Docker image for a FastAPI application. The FastAPI application is designed to handle queries that interact with a SQL database to retrieve data. We also provide instructions on how to deploy this Dockerized application on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction
his project demonstrates how to containerize a FastAPI application using Docker and deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster. The FastAPI application serves as an API that queries a SQL database for data retrieval.

## Features

- Dockerization of a FastAPI application.
- Kubernetes deployment for scaling and managing the FastAPI application.
- API queries that interact with a SQL database for data retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Docker: Install Docker on your local machine.
- Kubernetes Cluster: Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Kubernetes on a cloud provider).
- SQL Database: Have access to a SQL database that the FastAPI application will query.

### Dockerization

To containerize the FastAPI application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Kubernetes
1. Deploy my-secret-eal.yml
2. Deploy my-secret-eval.yml
3. Deploy my-deployment-eval.yml
